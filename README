CoursePicker
============

Created in Eclipse that connects to a SQL database of courses, divided by what requirement they fill, and allows the user to select and add courses to a schedule based on what requirement they select. Also has a view that displays a weekly calendar of the selected courses.


  --User is able to pick from a list of UGA requirements and get a list of all available courses that meet the selected requirements;
  --User has a graphical representation of their weekly schedule, created on the client side using the HTML 5 “Canvas” element and drawn using JavaScript.
  --User is able to add and remove courses from the schedule;
  --Application able to detect when the user selects a course that has a time conflict with a course that is already on the schedule, and resolves the conflict by the option of not adding the new course or by removing the old course.


Compile:
	through Eclipse.
	
Run:

	Code Broken; No longer have access to personal VM with mySQL (picker.jpg shows view when operational).
